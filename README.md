CloudPipe is a small web development company that builds websites for local businesses. Currently, their developers manually upload files to production servers whenever they make changes. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors.

They want to modernize their workflow by implementing a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys their website changes whenever code is pushed to GitHub. The goal is to make deployments faster, more reliable, and less stressful for their team.

The Problem Landscape

Let's look at their current challenges:

Manual Deployment Issues

Every time a developer needs to update a website, they have to:

Download the latest files from GitHub

Manually upload these files to the production server

Hope they didn't forget any files

Check if everything still works

For example, last week a developer forgot to upload an updated JavaScript file, causing the contact form to stop working for several hours before anyone noticed.

Time Wastage
Their developers spend valuable time on repetitive deployment tasks instead of building features. A simple text change on a website can take 15-20 minutes to deploy, when it should take seconds.

Solution Requirements:

CloudPipe needs a straightforward solution that automates their deployment process.

Core Requirements:

Automated Deployment

Code pushes to GitHub should trigger automatic deployments

Developers should see if their deployment succeeded or failed

Basic error notifications if something goes wrong

Infrastructure Needs

AWS S3 for static website hosting

GitHub Actions for automation

Simple deployment logs
